# Red Wine Quality Analysis

This project is dedicated to the analysis of red wine quality using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook which provides an interactive environment to explore and visualize the data.

## Description

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the necessary libraries and loading the red wine quality dataset.
2. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing different regression models to predict the quality of red wine.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
6. **Feature Importance**: Analyzing the importance of different features in predicting wine quality.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and providing recommendations for further analysis.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Joblib
- IPython
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

## How to Run

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python installed on your system along with the above-mentioned libraries. You can install the libraries using the `requirements.md` file provided in the repository.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Red Wine Quality dataset, which contains various chemical properties of wines and a quality rating for each wine.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the factors that contribute to the quality of red wine and predicts the quality based on the chemical properties of the wine.
